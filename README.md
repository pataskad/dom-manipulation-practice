***Project Breakdown***

This project, apart of 'The Odin Project', is a quick and crude setup built to practice dom manipulation via Javascript with an HTML skeleton using the established best practices I have acquired thus far.

This project will include a variety of utilities to show off varying ways to manipulate the DOM and interact between HTML and Javascript languages/files.
